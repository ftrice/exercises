<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p>I would really like to travel to Australia. It is the only country that is also a continent. Australia's climate
    varies from arid, rainy, tropical, and cold in some areas. Australians speak English, making communication much
    easier. Lastly, Australia has unique wildlife that only exists there.</p>

<h2>A person I admire (past or present)</h2>
<p>If I could meet someone I admire, it would have to be Hazel Scott. She was a famous African-American classically
    trained jazz pianist and entertainer. When Hollywood came calling, Hazel came on her own terms. She stood up for the
    rights of other African-American actors and made certain they were given respectful roles on the silver screen. </p>
